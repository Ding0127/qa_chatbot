      "question": "Why is it important to wash our hands?",
      "answers": {
        "Kindergarten": "Washing our hands is super important because it helps keep us healthy and happy! When we wash our hands with soap and water, we wash away dirt, germs, and yucky stuff that can make us sick. It's like giving our hands a little bath! We should wash our hands before we eat, after we play, and after using the potty. So remember, clean hands mean a happy and healthy you! Yay for washing hands!",
        "P1-P3": "Washing our hands is super important because it helps keep us healthy! Imagine your hands are like little superheroes that can get rid of germs, which are tiny villains that make us sick. When we wash our hands with soap and water, we’re sending those germs away, just like a superhero fights off bad guys! So, when we wash our hands before eating, after playing, or after using the bathroom, we're helping to protect ourselves and our friends from getting sick. It’s a simple way to be a health hero!",
        "P4-P6": "Washing our hands is important because it helps remove germs and dirt that can make us sick. Germs are tiny organisms, like bacteria and viruses, that we can't see with our eyes. They can be found on our hands after we touch things like doorknobs, money, or even our pets.\n\nWhen we wash our hands with soap and water, we create bubbles that help lift these germs off our skin. The soap breaks down the oils and dirt on our hands, making it easier to rinse them away. It's essential to wash our hands for at least 20 seconds, which is about the time it takes to sing the \"Happy Birthday\" song twice.\n\nProper handwashing is especially important before eating, after using the bathroom, and when we come home from outside. By keeping our hands clean, we can prevent the spread of illnesses like colds, flu, and stomach bugs. This not only protects us but also helps keep our friends and family healthy too!"
